## Building Regression Models with Keras
### Overview of Keras Library
The Keras library is a high-level API for building and training deep learning models. It simplifies the process of developing neural networks and can run on top of other deep learning libraries like TensorFlow.
### Importing and Using Keras
5. **Importing Keras:**
	- Import the Keras library and check the backend:
```python
import keras
print("Keras Backend:", keras.backend.backend())
```
	- The output will display the backend used, typically TensorFlow.
6. **Preparing the Data:**
	- Example data consists of the compressive strength of concrete samples based on their ingredients. The data is organized in a pandas DataFrame named `concrete_data`.
	- Split the DataFrame into predictors and target variables:
```python
predictors = concrete_data[['cement', 'slag', 'flyash', 'water', 'superplasticizer', 'coarseaggregate', 'fineaggregate']]
target = concrete_data['strength']
```

### Building a Regression Model
7. **Creating the Model:**
	- Import necessary modules:
```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
```
	- **Classes:**
		- `**Sequential**`** Model**: A linear stack of layers where you add layers sequentially.
		- `**Dense**`** Layer**: A fully connected layer in the network where each neuron in the layer is connected to every neuron in the previous layer.
	- Initialize the Sequential model:
```python
model = Sequential()
```
8. **Adding Layers:**
	- Add hidden and output layers:
```python
model.add(Dense(5, input_shape=(8,), activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(5, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1))
```
	- **Parameters Explained:**
		- `**Dense(units, input_shape=None, activation=None)**`:
			- `units`: Number of neurons in the layer.
			- `input_shape`: Shape of input data (only needed for the first layer). For example, `input_shape=(8,)` indicates 8 features.
			- `activation`: Activation function used by the layer. 'relu' is used for hidden layers, and no activation function is specified for the output layer to allow continuous output.

	- Split the dataset into predictors and target variables:
```python
predictors = car_data[['price_high', 'price_medium', 'price_low',
                       'maint_high', 'maint_medium', 'maint_low',
                       'capacity_two', 'capacity_more']]
