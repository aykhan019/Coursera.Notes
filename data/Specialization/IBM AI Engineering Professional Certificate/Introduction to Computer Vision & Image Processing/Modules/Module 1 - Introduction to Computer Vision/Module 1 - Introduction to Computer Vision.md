## Applications of Computer Vision
### Overview
In this section, we explore various applications of computer vision and discuss how you can develop your own applications.
### Searching Through Videos
One common challenge is searching through videos to find specific scenes. Traditionally, this requires fast-forwarding and manual searching. IBM has addressed this by tagging videos with keywords based on the objects present in each scene.

### Security and Object Recognition
Imagine a security company needing to find a suspect in a blue van among hours of footage. With computer vision and object recognition, this task becomes manageable and efficient, eliminating the need for extensive manual searching.
### Maintenance of Electric Towers
Electric towers require regular maintenance to check for rust and structural defects. Manually inspecting each tower is time-consuming and costly. Instead, high-resolution images can be taken from different angles, which are then analyzed using computer vision.
#### Custom Image Classifiers
By dividing high-resolution images into smaller segments, you can develop custom image classifiers. These classifiers can detect the presence of metal versus non-metal objects and assess the level of rust.
- **Metal Classifier**: Identifies metal structures in images.
- **Rust Classifier**: Determines the rust level based on predefined criteria, such as:
	- **Grade 1 Rust**: Minimal rust
	- **Grade 6 Rust**: Severe rust
This approach can save significant costs for industries like insurance by automating the analysis of thousands or millions of images.

### Image to Image Translation
Image to image translation involves converting an image from one representation to another. For example, transforming an image of a horse into a zebra or changing the scene of an image from summer to winter. Researchers at UC Berkeley are working on techniques for this kind of transformation, allowing for significant modifications in image content.

## Generating Ideas for Computer Vision Applications
### Introduction
This section encourages the exploration of potential computer vision applications by starting with existing problems and considering how computer vision can provide solutions.
### Identifying Existing Problems
Instead of beginning with a specific computer vision solution, it can be more effective to start by identifying problems that could be addressed. Here are some examples across various industries:
#### Medicine
One of the most challenging and time-consuming tasks in medicine is training doctors to accurately detect cancer. Developing computer vision tools that can assist in diagnosing cancer from medical images could help alleviate this problem.
#### Driving
Driving requires constant visual attention, and mistakes can have severe consequences. Additionally, long-distance drivers are at risk of falling asleep at the wheel. Computer vision could be used to develop systems that monitor driver alertness and provide warnings if necessary.
#### Security and Surveillance
In the security and surveillance industry, searching for a suspect across hours of footage is time-consuming. Computer vision can automate this process by efficiently identifying and tracking suspects. Additionally, detecting dangerous goods in X-rays at airports is challenging, and computer vision could improve the accuracy of these detections.
#### Manufacturing
In manufacturing, ensuring the quality of thousands of products is labor-intensive. Computer vision could be employed to automate quality control processes and detect defects in real-time.
#### Insurance and Work Safety
For insurance, evaluating damage from car accidents is a complex task that involves assessing the make, model, and year of the vehicle. Computer vision could streamline this process. Additionally, ensuring that construction workers wear appropriate safety gear is crucial for work safety, and computer vision can help in monitoring compliance.
### Personal and Everyday Problems
Consider problems you face in daily life or at work, and think about how computer vision could provide solutions:
- **Finding Receipts**: Computer vision could help in organizing and searching receipts for returns or exchanges.
- **Plant Identification**: Identify and track the growth of plants in your backyard using computer vision.
- **Rodent Problems**: Monitor and address rodent issues, such as raccoons rummaging through garbage bins.
### Summary
Exploring potential applications of computer vision involves identifying real-world problems and considering how technology can offer solutions. Think about challenges in your life, work, or industry to generate innovative ideas for computer vision applications.
