## Applications of Computer Vision
### Overview
In this section, we explore various applications of computer vision and discuss how you can develop your own applications.
### Searching Through Videos
One common challenge is searching through videos to find specific scenes. Traditionally, this requires fast-forwarding and manual searching. IBM has addressed this by tagging videos with keywords based on the objects present in each scene.
![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/03e82b26-cccb-4906-bb56-adabcbdc0655/6611b4b5-7716-4238-9394-371b7f97dd8d/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45FSPPWI6X%2F20241226%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20241226T171236Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=876e958c73d13c7fcd3f1d2fc4f9dc5a1684066cfc2d7a90afdc4ff5b37988b7&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)
### Security and Object Recognition
Imagine a security company needing to find a suspect in a blue van among hours of footage. With computer vision and object recognition, this task becomes manageable and efficient, eliminating the need for extensive manual searching.
### Maintenance of Electric Towers
Electric towers require regular maintenance to check for rust and structural defects. Manually inspecting each tower is time-consuming and costly. Instead, high-resolution images can be taken from different angles, which are then analyzed using computer vision.
#### Custom Image Classifiers
By dividing high-resolution images into smaller segments, you can develop custom image classifiers. These classifiers can detect the presence of metal versus non-metal objects and assess the level of rust.
- **Metal Classifier**: Identifies metal structures in images.
- **Rust Classifier**: Determines the rust level based on predefined criteria, such as:
	- **Grade 1 Rust**: Minimal rust
	- **Grade 6 Rust**: Severe rust
This approach can save significant costs for industries like insurance by automating the analysis of thousands or millions of images.
