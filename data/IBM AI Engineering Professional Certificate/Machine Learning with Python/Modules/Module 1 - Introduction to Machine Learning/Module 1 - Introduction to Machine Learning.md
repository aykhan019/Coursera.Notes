# Module 1: Introduction to Machine Learning
### What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It involves the development of algorithms that can recognize patterns, make decisions, and improve themselves over time.
### How Does Machine Learning Work?
Machine Learning algorithms, inspired by the human learning process, iteratively learn from data. These algorithms allow computers to discover hidden insights and patterns within large datasets. The models created through Machine Learning can assist in a variety of tasks, such as object recognition, text summarization, recommendation systems, and more.

### **Supervised vs Unsupervised Algorithms**
Understanding the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is fundamental in machine learning.
#### **Supervised Learning**
Supervised learning involves teaching a machine learning model using a labeled dataset. This means the model is trained on data where the input features and the output labels are known. For example, in a cancer dataset, features like clump thickness and cell size (attributes) are used to predict if a cell is malignant or benign (label). The goal is to predict future instances based on this training.
- **Types of Supervised Learning**:
	- **Classification**: Predicts discrete class labels. For example, classifying emails as spam or not spam.
	- **Regression**: Predicts continuous values. For example, predicting the CO2 emission of a car based on its engine size and number of cylinders.

#### **Unsupervised Learning**
Unsupervised learning involves training a model on data without labeled responses. The model tries to learn the underlying structure of the data on its own.
- **Common Unsupervised Learning Techniques**:
	- **Clustering**: Grouping data points into clusters based on their similarity. It is widely used for customer segmentation, organizing music genres, etc.
	- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features in the data to simplify the model and make the classification easier.
	- **Market Basket Analysis**: Identifying items that frequently co-occur in transactions.
	- **Density Estimation**: Exploring the data to find some underlying structure.

#### **Key Differences Between Supervised and Unsupervised**
- **Data**:
	- Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data.
	- Unsupervised Learning: Uses unlabeled data.
- **Techniques**:
	- Supervised Learning: Includes classification and regression.
	- Unsupervised Learning: Includes clustering, dimensionality reduction, market basket analysis, and density estimation.
- **Outcome Control**:
	- Supervised Learning: More controllable environment due to labeled data.
	- Unsupervised Learning: Less controllable, model draws conclusions from the data without predefined labels.
**Recap**
The main distinction between supervised and unsupervised learning is that supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, while unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data, allowing the model to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures. Supervised learning methods are more straightforward in terms of evaluation and control compared to the often complex algorithms and less predictable outcomes in unsupervised learning.
